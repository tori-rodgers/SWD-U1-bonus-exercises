/*
	Write a function that takes in an array of strings and checks to see if each string is a palindrome or not. The function should print the string "yes" or "no" for each string.

    Use the driver-navigator model for pair programming: the driver should share their screen and type up the pseudocode and/or code while the navigator directs the problem-solving and coding process. The driver should participate in discussion but not take over the navigating (aka drivergating)!
